#**Kargath Bladefist**
**Kargath Bladefist, Warlord of the Shattered Hand**, honed his brutal skills as a slave in the ogres’ gladiatorial games. He slaughtered countless opponents for the promise of freedom, but after winning, was locked away with the other retired “champions.” Fueled by rage, Kargath tore off his own hand to escape and led a revolt that soaked Draenor in ogre blood. Now, he returns to the arena to teach a lesson in the true meaning of savagery.

##**Roar of the Crowd** (Mythic-only)

Warlord of the Shattered Hand

###**Impale**
Kargath skewers an enemy, inflicting 72,559 Physical damage every 1 second for 7.50 seconds. If the target survives, they take increased damage from consecutive **Impales**.

###**Blade Dance**
With blinding speed, **Kargath** rushes random targets every 2 seconds for 10 seconds, doing 75,000 physical damage to anyone within 7 yards.

###**Berserker Rush**
Kargath cuts his way towards you dealing 125% weapon damage to all targets in front of him, as well as increasing his physical damage done by 15% every 2 seconds for 20 seconds.
In Mythic difficulty, the raid gains favor for **Roar of the Crowd** the longer Kargath stays in **Berserker Rush**. However, if Kargath’s fixate target dies, the raid loses a big chunk of favor.

###**Chain Hurl** [Important]
Kargath uses his chain to lash the 5 closest enemies and toss them into the arena’s stands.
